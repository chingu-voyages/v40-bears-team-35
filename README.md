# Recipe Roulette

This app provides a constant stream of curated recipes to the end user when it comes time to prepare a meal or go to the store.
The design for this app draws from that of Tinder, utilizing a swipe input to determine whether the user would like to choose
the recipe they've been shown or move on to another option.
